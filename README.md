# Abstract
Relevance and fairness are two major objectives of recommender systems (RSs). Recent work proposes measures of RS fairness that are either independent from relevance (fairness-only) or conditioned on relevance (joint measures). While fairness-only measures have been studied extensively, we look into whether joint measures can be trusted. We collect all joint evaluation measures of RS relevance and fairness, and ask: How much do they agree with each other? To what extent do they agree with relevance/fairness measures? How sensitive are they to changes in rank position, or to increasingly fair and relevant recommendations? We empirically study for the first time the behaviour of these measures across 4 real-world datasets and 4 recommenders. We find that most of these measures: i) correlate weakly with one another and even contradict each other at times; ii) are less sensitive to rank position changes than relevance- and fairness-only measures, meaning that they are less granular than traditional RS measures; and iii) tend to compress scores at the low end of their range, meaning that they are not very expressive. We counter the above limitations with a set of guidelines on the appropriate usage of such measures, i.e., they should be used with caution due to their tendency to contradict each other and of having a very small empirical range.

# Datasets

## Downloads
We use the following datasets, which can be downloaded from the Google Drive folder provided by [RecBole](https://recbole.io/dataset_list.html), under ProcessedDatasets:
- Amazon-lb: this dataset can be found in the Amazon2018 folder. The name of the folder is Amazon_Luxury_Beauty
- Lastfm is under the LastFM folder
- Ml-10m is under the MovieLens folder; the file is ml-10m.zip

1. Download the zip files corresponding to the full datasets (not the examples) and place them inside an empty `dataset` folder in the main folder.
2. Unzip the files.
3. Ensure that the name of the folder and the .inter files are the same as in the [dataset properties](https://github.com/theresiavr/can-we-trust-recsys-fairness-evaluation/tree/main/RecBole/recbole/properties/dataset).

QK-video can be downloaded from the link on the [Tenrec repository](https://github.com/yuangh-x/2022-NIPS-Tenrec).

## Preprocessing
Please follow the instructions in the notebooks under the `preproc_data` folder.
Further preprocessing settings are configured under `Recbole/recbole/properties/dataset`

# Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Please see the `cluster` folder to find the hyperparameter tuning script.
The hyperparameter search space can be found in  `Recbole/hyperchoice`, and the file `cluster/bestparam.txt` contains the best hyperparameter configurations.
